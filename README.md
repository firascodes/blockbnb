# Blockbnb

Blockbnb is a decentralized web application that allows users to book and list properties on the blockchain. It provides a transparent and secure platform for property owners and travelers, leveraging the power of smart contracts and decentralized technology.

## Description

Blockbnb aims to revolutionize the traditional property booking industry by eliminating intermediaries and enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions. Users can browse and book properties listed on the platform, while property owners can list their properties and manage bookings securely on the blockchain. The platform ensures transparency, trust, and fair pricing for all participants.

## Features

- **Decentralized Property Listing**: Property owners can list their properties on the blockchain, providing details such as location, amenities, availability, and pricing.
- **Secure Booking**: Users can securely book properties directly with the owners, without the need for intermediaries. Transactions are facilitated through smart contracts, ensuring trust and transparency.
- **Transparent Reviews**: Users can leave reviews for properties they have stayed at, and property owners can respond to these reviews. All reviews are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and preventing manipulation.
- **Decentralized Payments**: Payments for property bookings are handled through cryptocurrency transactions, eliminating the need for traditional payment gateways and associated fees.

## Tech Stack

Blockbnb is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A React framework for building server-rendered and static web applications.
- **Smart Contracts**: [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) - The programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
